# Chinese Temperature Predictions

Brief collection of R scripts for analyzing and predicting temperature and dew point patterns in China. The repository is intentionally code-only; datasets, images, and other outputs are not tracked.

## Files
- `Chinese_Climate.R`
- `Temperature_Predictions.R`
- `Dew_Point_Predictions.R`
- `Untitled.R`

## Notes
If you need data or figures, keep them local and run the scripts to regenerate outputs.
